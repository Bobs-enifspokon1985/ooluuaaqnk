Just left the theater, still feel like I've been spun around in a centrifuge. Brain's swirling like the mix of popcorn bits and stale soda sticking to the soles of my shoes. Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning — what even was that ending? My brain's on loop trying to figure out if the train falling off the cliff was cooler than the helicopter chase through the underground tunnels. Walls vibrating every time an explosion went off, think my back still aches from the seat vibing in sympathy.

Crazy how Ethan Hunt keeps pulling these stunts that make sense to exactly no one but him and the laws of physics seem to take a vacation just for him. MAsks off, masks on. Heck, at one point I was chewing my ticket — don't ask why, stress chewing maybe. The soundtrack! Was it in my bones or just my teeth clattering to the bass? Tom Cruise is like this super caffeine shot for the screen; can't decide if he's more stunt or more man at this point.

> Why does Simon Pegg's character always get the best one-liners? Comic relief like a wet towel in a sauna — cools you down but not really. Ving Rhames feeling like your trusty old umbrella you never want to part with — cozy and reliable. Vanessa Kirby's just wow, such energy, I thought she might just pounce through the screen and smack Hugh Grant round the ear with her purse, or was that the last movie? At one point I'm pretty sure I saw more helicopters than in actual air force footage.

Was thinking of when you mentioned downloading the movie — can already hear you laughing at the way the villain monologued. Oh man, the cinema was packed tighter than a commuters train on a Monday morning, no room for leg-stretching without kicking someone's bucket-sized soda over.

When the submarine emerged out of nowhere, was thinking how scientists must feel when equations explode into life — or maybe I'm just high on movie fumes. Theater was mad loud, felt like I was inside a giant microwave but instead of popcorn it was, well, my brains keep getting scrambled. Do download the movie if you can't make it to the theater, but doooon't pause, it kinda kills the buzz.

Mission: Impossible ain’t about following reality, it's like they took a jigsaw puzzle and just said hey, what if the dog chewed up half the pieces? and Ethan Hunt's still gonna solve it. The crowd clapped, like at the end of a magic show — makes sense, I guess I was part of the trick too.
